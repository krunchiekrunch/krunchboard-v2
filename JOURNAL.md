This is my journal of the design and building process of **krunchboard v2**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/72).


## 10/3/2025 - I decided the layout I wanted  

Since this is the v2 of krunchboard, this mainly fixes the mistakes from v1 by completely redesigning! Previously, I used a 85% layout, but I had to use a MCP23017 GPIO expander, which is a pain to get working in firmware since I was mixing the row/column pins with the MCU (RP2040 Pico). 

This time, I will not be using a GPIO expander, so I decided to use a slightly smaller layout for the keyboard, it will be 84+4 keys ANSI keyboard with a EC11 rotary encoder, the 4 keys will be macro switches so I can make it do shortcut actions! I originally wanted to make it ISO layout, but it was very hard to find keycaps set for ISO layout so I resorted to using ANSI layout.

This keyboard will be hotswappable so it will be plate mounted.

## 10/5/2025 - Made the schematic  

Today I completed the schematic. I decided to make the pico receive power and data via a external usb-c port so that I can put the pico under the space bar, on the back side to save space. The USB-C have 2 5.1k resistor to request 5v from a PD source, and there is reverse voltage protection just in case.

Since the pico will be on the other side, I also added external RST and BOOTSEL buttons.

I have 1 unused GPIO pin so maybe I can put some neopixels on the PCB.
